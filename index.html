            <div class="about-paras">
                <p class="about-para">I'm James, a tattoo artist originally from Southern California—raised on waves and sketchbooks. For me, surfing and art have always been about the same thing: telling stories without saying a word.</p>
                <p class="about-para">The first time I saw a tattoo, I was hooked. It was like a permanent story drawn onto skin—I decided then there was nothing else I wanted to do. Over the years, tattoos became my new canvas. And I wasn't just telling my own stories, I was helping others tell theirs too.</p>
                <p class="about-para">When I moved to Houston, it felt like a second home. This city gave me a shot to grow, and eventually a chance to open a shop of my own. Slow Wave Ink is my tribute to where I've been—and the stories still to tell.</p>
                <p class="about-para">That's my story. Let's ink yours next.</p>
